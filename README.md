# About
a letter is a game that i made about a lost small turtle named mohsen which is the pet of my girlfriend that must pass through level looking for his owner while listenning to clues about where could she be after each level, the game is highly specific for that one person which is my girlfriend and a part of the platforming might not catch the eyes of normal players
i uploaded it to github just to keep it as a record as it is the first game i ever made and i hope you like it
NOTE: i didn't upload my own recordings that you can listen to when you interact with the flags at the end of each level because they are highly personal and specific.
### Enjoy!
