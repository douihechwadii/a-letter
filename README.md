# About
A Letter is a game that I made about a lost small turtle named Mohsen which is the pet of my girlfriend that must pass through levels looking for his owner while listening to clues about where could she be after each level, the game is particular for that one person which is my girlfriend and a part of the platforming might not catch the eyes of normal players
I uploaded it to GitHub to keep it as a record as it is the first game I ever made and I hope you like it

NOTE: I didn't upload my recordings that you can listen to when you interact with the flags at the end of each level because they are highly personal and specific.
### Enjoy!
